# edge-ml
edge-ml helps developers build models faster and more robustly with an open-source toolchain for embedded machine learning. With a few simple steps edge-ml lets you record data, label samples, train models and deploy validated embedded machine learning directly on the edge. edge-ml requires minimal initilization and supports upload in real-time as well as in bulk from the edge. Pre-recorded data can also be drag-and-dropped as CSV files to the edge-ml cloud storage. Models are generated using AutoML therefore requiring minimal user configuration. The models are optimized for resource-constrained embedded chips based on hardware-aware neural network training.

# ðŸ’» For Developers

## Installation

Clone with `--recurse-submodules`-flag to automatically initialize and update each submodule.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:edge-ml/edge-ml.git
```

## Install with docker
Please follow the instructions to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/"> 
docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">install docker-compose</a>.

### Build and deploy your own images

Run the following command to build the images and to pull the mongoDB image.

```
sudo docker-compose build
```

Running the following command will start the dockerized application on your local machine:

```
docker-compose up
```
Services are now available:
* explorer-frontend: localhost
* explorer-backend: localhost/api
* explorer-auth: localhost/auth
* documentation: localhost/docs


## Deploy on a server

Run the following command to automatically pull and start the latestest version of the dockerized application from Docker Hub.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edge-ml/edge-ml/master/run.sh | sh
```
